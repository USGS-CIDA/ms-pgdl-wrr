  Process-guided deep learning water temperature predictions: 5c All lakes historical prediction data


abstract: >-
  Multiple modeling frameworks were used to predict daily temperatures at 0.5m depth intervals for a set of diverse lakes in the U.S.
  states of Minnesota and Wisconsin. Process-Based (PB) models were configured and calibrated with training data to reduce root-mean squared error.
  Uncalibrated models used default configurations (PB0; see Winslow et al. 2016 for details) and no parameters were adjusted according to model fit with observations.
  Deep Learning (DL) models were Long Short-Term Memory artificial recurrent neural network models which used training data to adjust model structure and weights for temperature predictions (Jia et al. 2019).
  Process-Guided Deep Learning (PGDL) models were DL models with an added physical constraint for energy conservation as a loss term. These models were pre-trained with
  uncalibrated Process-Based model outputs (PB0) before training on actual temperature observations. Zip files for each lake contain four files,
  one for each of PB, PB0, DL, and PGDL.
