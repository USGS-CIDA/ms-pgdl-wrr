  Process-guided deep learning water temperature predictions: 6a Lake Mendota detailed evaluation data

file-format: Three comma-separated files

abstract: >-
  This dataset includes "test data" compiled water temperature data from an instrumented buoy on Lake Mendota, WI and
  discrete (manually sampled) water temperature records from North Temperate Lakes Long-TERM Ecological Research Program (NTL-LTER; https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/).
  The buoy is supported by both the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (gleon.org) and the NTL-LTER. The dataset
  also includes Lake Mendota model erformance as measured as root-mean squared errors relative to temperature observations during the test period.
  This dataset is part of a larger data release of lake temperature model inputs and outputs for 68 lakes in the U.S.
  states of Minnesota and Wisconsin (http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/P9AQPIVD).
