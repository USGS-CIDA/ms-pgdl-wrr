  Process-guided deep learning water temperature predictions: 3b Sparkling Lake inputs

abstract: >-
  This dataset includes model inputs that describe local weather conditions for Sparkling Lake, WI. Weather data comes from two sources:
  locally measured (2009-2017) and gridded estimates (all other time periods). There are two comma-delimited files,
  one for weather data (one row per model timestep) and one for ice-flags, which are used by the process-guided deep learning model to
  determine whether to apply the energy conservation constraint (the constraint is not applied when the lake is presumed to be ice-covered).
  The ice-cover flag is a modeled output and therefore not a true measurement (see "Predictions" and "pb0" model type for the source of this prediction).
  This dataset is part of a larger data release of lake temperature model inputs and outputs for 68 lakes in the U.S.
  states of Minnesota and Wisconsin (http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/P9AQPIVD).

  Drivers indexed by lake used to drive lake models. NLDAS drivers are contemporary (1980-2018) meterology. Locally measured data were used
  in place of NLDAS for 2009-2017. Each folder contains a driver for each study lake,
  and has identical attributes (described above). NLDAS drivers (NLDAS.zip) are described in
  Mitchell et al. 2004.
